I have tried to computerize the hotel management system through my project.
The project is written in Python 3 that uses OOPS concept ie it is based on object and classes.

Simple Hotel Management System project is written in Python. The project file contains a python script (hms.py). This is a simple GUI based system which is very easy to understand and use. Talking about the system, it contains all the basic functions which include entering customer’s data, calculating room rent. In this mini project, there is no such login system. This means he/she can use all those available features easily without any restriction. It is too easy to use, he/she can check the total cost of staying in the hotel easily with each and every detail.
